title: 'Rate limits'
---

We presently apply a fixed rate limit of the allowed request rate and total number of API calls.

**Request rate**: 10 TPS  
**Total request limit (per day)**: 100  

Please carefully review your code for iterative API calls and ensure that these rate limits are adhered to. In the case the rate limits are exceeded, the client would receive **HTTP 429 - Too Many Requests** error response. You can use an exponential backoff interval to retry requests.

Please <a href="mailto:dev@swanvision.ai">reach out to us </a> if you have more specific requirements around rate limiting for your use case.
