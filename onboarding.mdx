## Signing up for a Swan account

1. A Swan account allows you to use Swan’s powerful AI models using our APIs and SDK.
2. If you haven’t already done so, please [sign up](/auth) using your email address. Choose the models you are interested in exploring and provide your billing information. You should receive an email with a magic link to authenticate your address.
3. With your account set up, you can manage your API keys, your team’s access, and billing preferences.
